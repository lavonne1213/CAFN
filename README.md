# CAFN: The Combination of Atrous and Fractionally Strided Convolutional Neural Networks for Understanding the Densely Crowded Scenes

This is main code of the paper CAFN: The Combination of Atrous and Fractionally Strided Convolutional Neural Networks for Understanding the Densely Crowded Scenes which is accepted at PRCV 2018.

Here we supply our model.py as a comparasion to MCNN(CVPR2016). I suggest you can read the detailed steps atÂ https://github.com/svishwa/crowdcount-mcnn, a pretty good unofficial implementation of MCNN. 

Following are the results of CAFN on Shanghai Tech A and B dataset:
    
     |     |  MAE    |   MSE    |
     ----------------------------
     | A   |  100.8  |   152.3  |
     ----------------------------
     | B   |   21.5  |   33.4   |
